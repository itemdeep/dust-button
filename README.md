# Dust Button Demo

A small frontend demo for **ItemGG / ItemDeep** that showcases a **delete button disintegration effect** (dust / smoke particles) using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas)**.

## Preview

Click the **Delete** button to trigger:
- button press animation
- fade + blur
- particle/dust disintegration effect

Then use **Show Again** to reset and test again.

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Canvas API (for particle effects)

## How to Run

### Option 1 (Quick)
Open `dust-button-demo/index.html` directly in your browser.

### Option 2 (Recommended)
Use **VS Code + Live Server** for easier testing during edits.

- Install the **Live Server** extension
- Open the `dust-button-demo` folder in VS Code
- Right-click `index.html`
- Select **Open with Live Server**

## Features

- Dark UI background
- Click-to-disintegrate delete button animation
- Particle + smoke-like effect
- Reset button to replay animation
- Lightweight (no framework dependencies)

## Notes

- This is a visual demo/prototype for UI animation experimentation for **ItemGG / ItemDeep** interfaces.
- The current implementation focuses on animation feel and fast iteration.
- It can be adapted into larger UI flows (confirm dialogs, destructive actions, etc.).

## Possible Improvements

- Separate disintegration for icon and label
- More advanced smoke physics / easing
- Mobile touch optimizations
- Configurable particle count and colors
- React / Framer Motion version
- Sound effect toggle (optional)
- Accessibility improvements (reduced motion support)
